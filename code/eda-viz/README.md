# eda-viz

This folder mainly holds notebooks used to visualize the data and help inform the decision making and model building process. The `pre_proj` folder contains notebooks that helped to explore the data and scope out the project before getting started. The `in_proj` folder contains notebooks that helped to explore the data once I had a reasonable idea of the project scope.
